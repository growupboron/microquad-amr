# B-QuaD
## Team Micro(s)QuaD's answer to fight against Anti Microbial Resistance (AMR).

### **User experience mockup** developed as part of the CBI ATTRACT project. 

This codebase **simulates** B-QuaD (proposed system) which uses biosensors, [MicroQuaD](https://attract-eu.com/projects/microquad-material-science/) and deep learning / computer vision to detect bacterial infections in blood samples with high precision nearly instanteously. The vision for this innovation is to disrupt the medical industry and contribute to [United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)](https://sdgs.un.org/) of Good Health & Well Being and Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure.
